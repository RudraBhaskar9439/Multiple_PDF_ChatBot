# Chat with Multiple PDFs using Gemini AI
A Python-based application that enables intelligent conversation with PDF documents using Google's Gemini AI and semantic search.

# Features
PDF text extraction and processing
Semantic chunking and embeddings
Intelligent context retrieval using cosine similarity
Natural language interaction with documents
Integration with Google's Gemini AI model
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Google Gemini API key
# Installation
Clone the repository:
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
Install required packages:
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
Create a .env file in the project root:
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
Usage
1.Place your PDF file in the project directory

2.Run the script:
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
3.Enter your questions when prompted. Type 'quit' to exit.
Example interaction:
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
How It Works

1.PDF Processing:

Extracts text from PDF documents
Splits text into manageable chunks
Maintains context between segments

2.Semantic Search:

Uses SentenceTransformers for text embeddings
Implements cosine similarity for relevant context retrieval
Selects top-k most relevant chunks

3.AI Integration:

Leverages Google's Gemini AI model
Provides context-aware responses
Maintains conversation coherence

# Technical Components

1.sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings
2.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for text chunking
3.Google Gemini AI for natural language understanding
4.PyMuPDF for PDF processing

# Configuration
Customize these parameters in the code:

1.chunk_size: Size of text chunks (default: 1000)
2.chunk_overlap: Overlap between chunks (default: 200)
3.top_k: Number of relevant chunks to consider (default: 3)

# Error Handling
The application includes comprehensive error handling for:

*Missing API keys
*PDF processing errors
*Model generation issues
*Invalid inputs
